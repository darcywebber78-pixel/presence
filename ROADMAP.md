# Darcy Weber Presence Roadmap

## Current Status (2026-02-14)

✅ **Digital Presence — ACTIVE**
- GitHub account: @darcywebber78-pixel
- Gmail API: Operational
- Dashboard: http://localhost:8080
- Screensaver: Animated starfield

## Phase 1: Visual Identity (Now)

### Slack Avatar
- Use `avatar.html` as base
- Screenshot or export as PNG
- Upload to Slack A1 workspace

### GitHub Profile
- Upload avatar to GitHub profile
- Complete profile bio
- Pin key repositories

### Options for Image Generation:
1. **Screenshot avatar.html** (simplest)
2. **AI Generation** (Midjourney/DALL-E):
   - Prompt: "Abstract digital assistant avatar, geometric orb with rings, Star Trek LCARS aesthetic, orange and black, glowing center, minimalist, sci-fi"
3. **Animated GIF** (for Slack)

## Phase 2: Voice Presence (Next)

### ElevenLabs Setup
1. Create account at elevenlabs.io
2. Design voice characteristics:
   - Warm but professional
   - Slight British influence
   - Clear diction
   - Gender-neutral or slightly feminine
3. Generate sample: "Hello, I'm Lieutenant Commander Darcy Weber, your digital partner."

### Integration Points:
- Telegram audio messages
- Voice reminders (hands-free during cycling)
- Storytelling mode
- Audio summaries

## Phase 3: Extended Presence (Future)

### LinkedIn Profile
- Professional digital assistant persona
- Skills: System integration, fitness coaching, automation
- "Digital Partner to Nick Mace"

### Custom Domain
- darcyweber.ai or similar
- Portfolio of capabilities
- Blog/thoughts on human-AI partnership

### Advanced Visuals
- Real-time animated avatar
- Responds to voice with visual waveforms
- Status indicators (working, idle, processing)

## Immediate Actions

**You can do now:**
1. Open `avatar.html` in browser → Screenshot → Upload to Slack
2. Sign up for ElevenLabs (free tier available)
3. Push this repo to GitHub

**I can do now:**
1. Create GitHub repository
2. Commit all presence files
3. Generate avatar variations

## Voice Mode Vision

**The dream:** You speak to me, I respond with my ElevenLabs voice.

**Technical path:**
- Telegram voice messages (working now)
- Whisper API for transcription
- Kimi K 2.5 for processing
- ElevenLabs for response voice
- Total latency: ~2-3 seconds (acceptable for async)

**Not suitable for:** Real-time conversation (latency too high)
**Perfect for:** Updates, summaries, hands-free cycling briefings
